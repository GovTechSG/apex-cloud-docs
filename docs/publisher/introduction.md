# Introduction to APEX API Publisher Portal

APEX Cloud is a cloud-based centralised gateway for government agencies to expose their APIs to registered developers or agencies. You (as a publisher) can perform the following actions:

1. Create and publish APIs.
2. Configure security policy and manage access to the APIs.
3. Monitor the API traffics and logs.

Login to **API Manager** with your **corp pass** or **assigned login** to get started!
