# Introduction to APEX API Developer Portal

APEX API Developer Portal is a self-service web-based portal that enables API consumers to consume APIs that are listed.
You (as a developer) can register and manage your user profile, register applications, manage application credentials, browse APIs and supporting documentation, monitor application API usage, and so on.

## Getting Started

Before you can use the Developer Portal, you will have to **sign up** for a new account. After signing up, you will need to **create an application** in order to consume APIs in the Portal.
