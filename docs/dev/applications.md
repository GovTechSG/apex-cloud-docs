# Applications

Applications allow app developers to generate credentials (API Key, OAuth, or
external credentials) to consume APIs that are protected by authentication.

Once created, App developers can register the API use of their applications
through graphical real-time charts.

## Creating an application

The first step to consuming APIs, is to first create an application. This can be
found in the **Applications** tab in the menu bar.
